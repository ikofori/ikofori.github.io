Hi, welcome [(Akwaaba)](https://mfa.gov.gh/index.php/about-ghana/) to my page!



## Get to Know Me in 30 Seconds

I am a [Development Economist](https://ikofori.github.io/) and currently an Assistant Lecturer in the [School of Accounting, Economics, and Finance](https://www.tudublin.ie/explore/faculties-and-schools/business/accounting-economics-and-finance/) of [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/) in Ireland. I have a strong research and teaching portfolio in [Development Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223) and [Applied Econometrics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004). 

I employ data science, econometrics, and machine learning skills to generate evidence and inform interventions that advance social progress. In particular, I lead research efforts aimed at tracking the progress of countries/territories in [Inclusive Green Growth](https://zenodo.org/records/12529764). 

My current research agenda centres on innovation, impact evaluation, green transition, and inclusive green growth. Recent publications from this agenda have appeared in leading journals such as [World Development](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223), [Structural Change & Economic Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004), [Empirical Economics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-025-02744-x), [Energy Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106414), [International Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inteco.2024.100509), and [Economic Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101055)
