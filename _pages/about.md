Hi, welcome to my webpage!

## About me

I am a Researcher at [Maynooth University](https://www.maynoothuniversity.ie/). I hold a PhD in Economics (Methods and Models for Economic Decisions, with a strong research and teaching portfolio in **Development Economics** and **Applied Econometrics**. 

I combine data science, econometrics, and machine learning skills to address social progress issues. I lead research efforts aimed at tracking the progress of countries/territories in Inclusive Green Growth. My current research agenda centres on innovation, impact evaluation, green transition, and inclusive green growth.

My recent contributions to the social progress scholarship have also appeared in handbooks and leading journals, including **World Development**, **Structural Change & Economic Dynamics**, **Empirical Economics**, **Energy Economics**, **International Economics**, and **Economic Systems**.
