Hi, welcome to my webpage!

## About me

I am an [Economist](https://ikofori.github.io/) based in Dublin, Ireland. I hold a PhD in Economics [(Methods and Models for Economic Decisions)](https://www.uninsubria.it/formazione/offerta-formativa/methods-and-models-economic-decisions-xli-ciclo) from the [University of Insubria](https://archivio.uninsubria.it/siti-tematici-o-federati/siti-dei-dipartimenti/dipartimento-di-economia-dieco) in Italy. I have a strong research and teaching portfolio in [Development Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223) and [Applied Econometrics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004). 

I employ data science, econometrics, and machine learning to generate evidence and inform interventions that advance social progress. In particular, I lead research efforts aimed at tracking the progress of countries/territories in [Inclusive Green Growth](https://zenodo.org/records/12529764). 

My current research agenda centres on innovation, impact evaluation, green transition, and inclusive green growth. Recent publications from this agenda have appeared in leading journals such as [World Development](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223), [Structural Change & Economic Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004), [Empirical Economics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-025-02744-x), [Energy Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.eneco.2022.106414), [International Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inteco.2024.100509), and [Economic Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101055)
