Hi, welcome [(Akwaaba)](https://mfa.gov.gh/index.php/about-ghana/) to my page!



## Get to Know Me in 30 Seconds

I lecture in the [School of Accounting, Economics, and Finance](https://researchprofiles.tudublin.ie/en/persons/a86f0fa2-e615-4fe1-86ff-d679d9b2a895) at [Technological University Dublin](https://www.tudublin.ie/), Ireland. My work sits at the intersection of [Development Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223), [International Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inteco.2024.100509), and [Applied Econometrics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004). 

I employ data science and econometrics to produce evidence that informs interventions for social progress. A central strand of my work focuses on measuring and tracking countries’ performance in [Inclusive Green Growth](https://zenodo.org/records/12529764). 

My recent publications have appeared in [World Development](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.worlddev.2025.107223), [Ecological Economics](https://www.econstor.eu/handle/10419/335106), [Structural Change & Economic Dynamics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.strueco.2025.09.004), [Empirical Economics](https://doi.org/10.1007/s00181-025-02744-x), [International Economics](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.inteco.2024.100509), and [Economic Systems](https://doi.org/10.1016/j.ecosys.2022.101055)
